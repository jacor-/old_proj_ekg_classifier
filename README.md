**Old code corresponding to an ECG (electrocardiogram) classifier built some years ago (2013-2014)**

# Content

This repository explores a Neural Network approach to detect beats and classify them as normal or pathological ones.

# Project history

The base code of the project corresponds to my final master thesis. 
The Neural Network approach was built on top of that and uses some of the previous code as tools.

# Project Status

The code is not testable anymore since the base dataset is owned by the company who sponsored the project.
