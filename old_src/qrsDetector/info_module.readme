This class provides a friendly interface for the QRS detection. 

If you want to detect QRS complexes given a signal, just clean it (filter it and remove the wandering line) and import a detector from the setDetector module.

It returns the position of all the ECG complexes that it find.

These module uses the rest of packages on this module. The transformations and thresholds are the core of the detector module.

The supervision module's function is the detection and correction of errors in the detection made.
